**Reviving Xeon Phi 5110P for AI & HPC on Modern Linux Distributions**

In the regular basic education sector in Lima, Peru, there is a growing need for cost-effective AI solutions to support educational initiatives, such as personalized learning, automated assessment, and intelligent tutoring systems. However, deploying AI models like 7B and 14B parameter models requires significant computational resources, which are often beyond the financial reach of educational institutions with limited budgets.  

The Intel Xeon Phi 5110P presents itself as a potential low-cost alternative for AI workloads due to its high parallel computing capabilities. However, a critical barrier to its adoption on modern operating systems such as AlmaLinux 8.1 is the lack of readily available drivers and utilities. Since Intel has discontinued support for the Xeon Phi architecture, newer Linux distributions no longer include the necessary software components to fully utilize these coprocessors.  

This challenge leaves educators and developers in the region without a viable path to repurpose existing Xeon Phi hardware for AI inference and training. To bridge this gap, it is essential to develop or adapt driver support and utilities that allow full utilization of the Xeon Phi 5110P on AlmaLinux 8.1, ensuring compatibility with modern AI frameworks while maintaining system stability and performance. Addressing this issue would enable low-budget institutions to leverage affordable, older hardware for AI-based educational tools, promoting technological inclusion and innovation in Limaâ€™s education sector.
